# SATikuti, SAT solver

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

SAT solver (using brute-force strategy). SAT, also known as [boolean satisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem#Self-reducibility), is a NP-hard problem. There are no known algorithms that solve SAT efficently in all cases but some algoritms exist that work in most cases.

## Usage

````ruby satsolver.rb satfile````

Satfile should be in [simplified DIMACS CNF format](http://www.satcompetition.org/2009/format-benchmarks2009.html).
